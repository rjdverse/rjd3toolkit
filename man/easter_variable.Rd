\item{frequency}{Frequency of the series, number of periods per year
(12, 4, 3, 2...)}

\item{start, length}{First date (array with the first year and the first
period, for instance \code{c(1980, 1)}) and number of periods of the output
variables. Can also be provided with the \code{s} argument}

\item{s}{time series used to get the dates for the trading days variables.
If supplied the parameters \code{frequency}, \code{start} and \code{length} are ignored.}

\item{duration}{Duration (length in days) of the Easter effect. (value between 1 and 20, default =6)}

\item{endpos}{Position of the end of the Easter effect, relatively to Easter:
-1(default): before Easter Sunday, 0: on Easter Sunday, 1: on Easter Monday)}

\item{correction}{mean correction option. Simple"(default), "PreComputed", "Theoretical" or "None".}
