\title{Display Long-term means for a set of calendar regressors}
\usage{
long_term_mean(
  calendar,
  frequency,
  groups = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0),
  holiday = 7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{calendar}{The calendar containing the required holidays}

\item{frequency}{Frequency of the series, number of periods per year
(12, 4, 3, 2...)}

\item{groups}{Groups of days. The length of the array must be 7. It indicates
to what group each week day belongs. The first item corresponds to Mondays
and the last one to Sundays. The group used for contrasts (usually Sundays)
is identified by 0. The other groups are identified by 1, 2,... n (<= 6).
For instance, usual trading days are defined by c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0), week
days by c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0), week days, Saturdays, Sundays by
c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0) etc.}

\item{holiday}{Day to aggregate holidays with. (holidays are considered as
that day). 1 for Monday... 7 for Sunday. Doesn't necessary belong to the
0-group.}
}
\value{
returns an object of class \code{c("matrix","array")} with the long term means corresponding
to each group/period, starting with the 0-group.
}
\description{
Given a pre-defined calendar and set of groups, the function displays the long-term means which
would be used to seasonally adjust the corresponding regressors, as the final value using
contrasts is "number of days in the group - long term mean".
}
\details{
A long-term mean is a probability based computation of the average value for every period in every group.
(see references). For monthly regressors there are 12 types of periods (January to December).
