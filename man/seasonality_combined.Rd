\title{"X12" Test On Seasonality}
\usage{
seasonality_combined(
  data,
  period = NA,
  firstperiod = cycle(data)[1],
  mul = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the input data.}

\item{period}{Tested periodicity. Can be missing if the input is a time series}

\item{firstperiod}{Position in a cycle of the first obs.
For example, for a monthly, \code{firstperiod = 1} means January.
If \code{data} is not a \code{"ts"} object, \code{firstperiod = 1} by default.}

\item{mul}{boolean indicating if the seasonal decomposition is multiplicative (\code{mul = TRUE}) or additive (\code{mul = FALSE}).}
