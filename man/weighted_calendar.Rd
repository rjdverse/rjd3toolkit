\details{
Composite calendars are useful for a series that including data from more than one country/region.
They can be used, for example, to create the calendar for the European Union or to create the national calendar for a country,
in which regional holidays are celebrated.
For example, in Germany public holidays are determined by the federal states.
Therefore, Epiphany is celebrated only in Baden-Wurttemberg, Bavaria and in Saxony-Anhalt, while from 1994 Day of Repentance and Prayer is celebrated only in Saxony.
