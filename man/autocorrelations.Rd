\usage{
autocorrelations(data, mean = T, n = 15)

autocorrelations_partial(data, mean = T, n = 15)

autocorrelations_inverse(data, nar = 30, n = 15)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data being tested.}

\item{mean}{Mean correction. If \code{TRUE}, the auto-correlations are computed as usual.
If \code{FALSE}, we consider that the (known) mean is 0 and that the series has been corrected for it.}

\item{n}{maximum lag at which to calculate the stats.}

\item{nar}{number of AR lags used to compute inverse autocorrelations.}
}
