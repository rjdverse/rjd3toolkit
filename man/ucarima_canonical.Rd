\title{Makes a UCARIMA model canonical; more specifically, put all the noise of the components in one dedicated component}
\usage{
ucarima_canonical(ucm, cmp = 0, adjust = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ucm}{An UCARIMA model returned by \code{\link[=ucarima_model]{ucarima_model()}}.}

\item{cmp}{Index of the component that will contain the noises; 0 if a new component with all the noises will be added to the model}

\item{adjust}{If TRUE, some noise could be added to the model to ensure that all the components has positive (pseudo-)spectrum}
}
\value{
A new UCARIMA model
}
