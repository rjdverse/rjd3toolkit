\usage{
set_benchmarking(
  x,
  enabled = NA,
  target = c(NA, "CalendarAdjusted", "Original"),
  rho = NA,
  lambda = NA,
  forecast = NA,
  bias = c(NA, "None")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the specification to customize, must be a "SPEC" class object (see details).}

\item{enabled}{Boolean to enable the user to perform benchmarking.}

\item{target}{specifies the target series for the benchmarking procedure,
which can be the raw series (\code{"Normal"}); or the series adjusted for calendar effects (\code{"CalendarAdjusted"}).}

\item{rho}{the value of the AR(1) parameter (set between 0 and 1) in the function used for benchmarking. Default =1.}

\item{lambda}{a parameter in the function used for benchmarking that relates to the weights in the regression equation; it is typically equal to 0, 1/2 or 1.}

\item{forecast}{Boolean indicating if the forecasts of the seasonally adjusted series and of the target variable (\code{target}) are used in the benchmarking computation so that the benchmarking constrain is also applied to the forecasting period.}

\item{bias}{TODO}
}
\description{
Function allowing to perform a benchmarking procedure after the decomposition step in a seasonal
adjustment (disabled by default). Here benchmarking refers to a procedure ensuring consistency over the year between
seasonally adjusted and raw (or calendar adjusted) data, as seasonal adjustment can cause discrepancies between the annual totals of seasonally adjusted series
and the corresponding annual totals of raw (or calendar adjusted) series.

\details{
\code{x} specification param must be a JD3_X13_SPEC" class object generated with \code{rjd3x13::spec_x13()}
(or "JD3_REGARIMA_SPEC" generated with \code{rjd3x13::spec_regarima()} or "JD3_TRAMOSEATS_SPEC"
generated with \code{rjd3tramoseats::spec_tramoseats()} or "JD3_TRAMO_SPEC" generated with
\code{rjd3tramoseats::spec_tramo()}).

#                            rho = 0.8,
#                            lambda = 0.5,
