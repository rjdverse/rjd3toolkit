set_benchmarking(
  x,
  enabled = NA,
  target = c(NA, "CalendarAdjusted", "Original"),
  rho = NA,
  lambda = NA,
  forecast = NA,
  bias = c(NA, "None")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the specification to customize, must be a "SPEC" class object (see
details).}

\item{enabled}{Boolean to enable the user to perform benchmarking.}

\item{target}{specifies the target series for the benchmarking procedure,
which can be the raw series (\code{"Normal"}); or the series adjusted for
calendar effects (\code{"CalendarAdjusted"}).}

\item{rho}{the value of the AR(1) parameter (set between 0 and 1) in the
function used for benchmarking. Default =1.}

\item{lambda}{a parameter in the function used for benchmarking that relates
to the weights in the regression equation; it is typically equal to 0, 1/2
or 1.}

\item{forecast}{Boolean indicating if the forecasts of the seasonally
adjusted series and of the target variable (\code{target}) are used in the
benchmarking computation so that the benchmarking constrain is also applied
to the forecasting period.}

\item{bias}{TODO}
}
\description{
Function allowing to perform a benchmarking procedure after the decomposition
step in a seasonal adjustment (disabled by default). Here benchmarking refers
to a procedure  ensuring consistency over the year between seasonally
adjusted and raw (or calendar adjusted) data, as seasonal  adjustment can
cause discrepancies between the annual totals of seasonally  adjusted series
and the corresponding annual totals of raw (or calendar adjusted) series.
