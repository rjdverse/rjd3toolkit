\title{Automatic differencing}
\usage{
differencing_fast(data, period, mad = TRUE, centile = 90, k = 1.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Series being differenced.}

\item{period}{Period considered in the automatic differencing.}

\item{mad}{Use of MAD in the computation of the variance (true by default).}

\item{centile}{Percentage of the data used for computing the variance (90 by default).}

\item{k}{tolerance in the decrease of the variance. The algorithm stops if the new variance is higher than k*the old variance. k should be equal or slightly higher than 1 (1.2 by default)}
}
\value{
Stationary transformation
\itemize{
\item \code{ddata}: data after differencing
\item \code{mean}: mean correction
\item \code{differences}:
\itemize{
\item \code{lag}: \eqn{ddata(t)=data(t)-data(t-lag)}
\item \code{order}: order of the differencing
}
}
}
\description{
The series is differenced till its variance is decreasing.
