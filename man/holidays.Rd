\title{Daily calendar regressors corresponding to holidays}
\usage{
holidays(
  calendar,
  start,
  length,
  nonworking = c(6, 7),
  type = c("Skip", "All", "NextWorkingDay", "PreviousWorkingDay"),
  single = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{calendar}{The calendar in which the holidays are defined.}

\item{start}{Starting date for the regressors, format \code{"YYYY-MM-DD"}.}

\item{length}{Length of the regressors in days.}

\item{nonworking}{Indexes of non working days (Monday=1, Sunday=7).}

\item{type}{Adjustment type when a holiday falls on a week-end:
\code{"NextWorkingDay"}: the holiday is set to the next day,
\code{"PreviousWorkingDay"}: the holiday is set to the previous day,
\code{"Skip"}: holidays corresponding to non working days are simply skipped in the matrix,
\code{"All"}: (holidays are always put in the matrix, even if they correspond to a non working day.}

\item{single}{Boolean indication if a single variable (\code{TRUE}) should be returned or a matrix (\code{FALSE}, the default) containing the different holidays in separate columns.}
}
\value{
A matrix (class \code{"matrix"}) where each column is associated to a holiday (in the order of creation of the holiday) and each row to a date.
}
\description{
Allows to generate daily regressors (dummy variables) corresponding to each holiday of a pre-defined calendar.
}
\details{
The pre-defined in a calendar has to be created with the functions \code{\link{national_calendar}} or \code{\link{weighted_calendar}} or
\code{\link{weighted_calendar}}. A many regressors  as defined holidays are generated, when the holiday occurs
the value is 1 and 0 otherwise.
This kind of non-aggregated regressors are used for calendar correction in daily data.
