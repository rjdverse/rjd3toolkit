\title{Trading day regressors with pre-defined holidays}
\usage{
calendar_td(
  calendar,
  frequency,
  start,
  length,
  s,
  groups = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0),
  holiday = 7,
  contrasts = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{calendar}{The calendar containing the required holidays}

\item{frequency}{Frequency of the series, number of periods per year
(12, 4, 3, 2...)}

\item{start, length}{First date (array with the first year and the first
period, for instance \code{c(1980, 1)}) and number of periods of the output
variables. Can also be provided with the \code{s} argument}

\item{s}{time series used to get the dates for the trading days variables.
If supplied the parameters \code{frequency}, \code{start} and \code{length} are ignored.}

\item{groups}{Groups of days. The length of the array must be 7. It indicates
to what group each week day belongs. The first item corresponds to Mondays
and the last one to Sundays. The group used for contrasts (usually Sundays)
is identified by 0. The other groups are identified by 1, 2,... n (<= 6).
For instance, usual trading days are defined by c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0), week
days by c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0), week days, Saturdays, Sundays by
c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0) etc.}

\item{holiday}{Day to aggregate holidays with. (holidays are considered as
that day). 1 for Monday... 7 for Sunday. Doesn't necessary belong to the
0-group.}

\item{contrasts}{If true, the variables are defined by contrasts with the
0-group. Otherwise, raw number of days is provided.}
}
\value{
Time series (object of class \code{c("ts","mts","matrix")})
corresponding to each group, starting with the 0-group
(\code{contrasts = FALSE}) or the 1-group (\code{contrasts = TRUE}).
}
\description{
Allows to generate trading day regressors (as many as defined groups), taking
into account 7 or less different types of days, from Monday to Sunday, and
specific holidays,which are to defined beforehand in a calendar using the
functions \code{national_calendar},\code{weighted_calendar} or \code{Chained_calendar}.
}
\details{
Aggregated values for monthly or quarterly are the numbers of days belonging
to a given group, holidays are all summed together in of those groups.
Contrasts are the differences between the number of days in a given group
(1 to 6) and the number of days in the reference group (0).
Regressors are corrected for long-term mean if \code{contrasts = TRUE}.
