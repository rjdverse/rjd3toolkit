# Create a National Calendar

Will create a calendar as a list of days corresponding to the required
holidays. The holidays have to be generated by one of these functions:
[`fixed_day()`](https://rjdverse.github.io/rjd3toolkit/reference/fixed_day.md),
[`fixed_week_day()`](https://rjdverse.github.io/rjd3toolkit/reference/fixed_week_day.md),
[`easter_day()`](https://rjdverse.github.io/rjd3toolkit/reference/easter_day.md),
[`special_day()`](https://rjdverse.github.io/rjd3toolkit/reference/special_day.md)
or
[`single_day()`](https://rjdverse.github.io/rjd3toolkit/reference/single_day.md).

## Usage

``` r
national_calendar(days = list(), mean_correction = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- days:

  list of holidays to be taken into account in the calendar

- mean_correction:

  TRUE if the variables generated by this calendar will contain long
  term mean corrections (default). FALSE otherwise.

## Value

returns an object of class `c("JD3_CALENDAR","JD3_CALENDARDEFINITION")`

# Fictional calendar using all possibilities to set the required holidays
MyCalendar <- national_calendar(list(
    fixed_day(7, 21),
    special_day("NEWYEAR"),
    special_day("CHRISTMAS"),
    fixed_week_day(7, 2, 3), # second Wednesday of July
    special_day("MAYDAY"),
    easter_day(1), # Easter Monday
    easter_day(-2), # Good Friday
    single_day("2001-09-11"), # appearing once
    special_day("ASCENSION"),
    easter_day(
        offset = 60, julian = FALSE, weight = 0.5,
        validity = list(start = "2000-01-01", end = "2020-12-01")
    ), # Corpus Christi
    special_day("WHITMONDAY"),
    special_day("ASSUMPTION"),
    special_day("ALLSAINTSDAY"),
    special_day("ARMISTICE")
))
